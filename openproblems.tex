\section{Open problems}
\label{sec:openproblems}

Besides the open problems listed throughout the paper, we consider the following questions to be worth exploring.
\begin{itemize}
\item There are many problems of \emph{inequivalence} in \cite{gj79} which are listed as \NP-complete or \PSPACE-complete.
  What do these problems have to do with \NPEq-completeness, \coNPEq-completeness, and \PSPACEEq-completeness?
\item Do the complexity results from, for example, \cite{at96} or \cite{rs11}, which study isomorphisms and congruences of boolean formulae, boolean circuits, polynomials, and other structures, translate to the setting of kernel reductions?
\end{itemize}
