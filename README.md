## Compilation dependencies ##

Besides `pdflatex`, compile-time dependencies include the following LaTeX
packages:

* `aliascnt`
* `amsthm`
* `amsmath`
* `amssymb`
* `complexity`
* `hyperref`
* `xy`

On Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10, the necessary system packages which contain these
LaTeX packages are:

* `texlive-base`
* `texlive-latex-base`
* `texlive-pictures`
* `texlive-science`

To install them, run

    sudo apt-get install texlive-base texlive-latex-base texlive-pictures \
      texlive-science

If for some reason you wish to compile the document as a Postscript file
instead of a PDF file, you must (on Ubuntu 11.10) install the following
additional system packages:

* `texlive-fonts-recommended`

To install them, run

    sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended

To compile the poster which corresponds to the article, compile-time
dependencies include the following LaTeX packages:

* `amsmath`
* `amsthm`
* `complexity`
* `type1cm`
* `tkz-graph`
* `xy`

On Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10, the necessary system packages which contain these
LaTeX packages are:

* `texlive-latex-base`
* `texlive-latex-extra`
* `texlive-science`

To install them, run

    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-science

## Compiling ##
