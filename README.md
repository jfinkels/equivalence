## Compilation dependencies ##

Besides `pdflatex`, compile-time dependencies include the following LaTeX
packages:

* `amsthm`
* `amsmath`
* `amssymb`
* `babel`
* `biblatex`
* `complexity`
* `csquotes`
* `hyperref`
* `textcomp`
* `thmtools`
* `thm-restate`
* `oberdiek` (which is actually a collection of LaTeX packages)
* `xy`

To install these on Ubuntu 11.04 through 14.04, run

    sudo apt-get install texlive-base texlive-latex-base texlive-pictures \
      texlive-science

The [Theory of Computing][2] LaTeX package is required, but a version of this
package is included in this package in the directory `toctex`. The `toctex`
package was downloaded from the [Theory of Computing website][2] and the
`tocbase.cls` file was modified as described in the next section.

If for some reason you wish to compile the document as a Postscript file (using
the `pslatex` command) instead of a PDF file, you must (on Ubuntu 11.10)
install the following additional system package:

[3]: http://ctan.org/pkg/oberdiek

## Modifications to the `tocbase.cls` file ##

The following modifications were made to the `tocbase.cls` file from the
original downloaded from the Theory of Computing website.

* Added `\RequirePackage{aliascnt}`.
* Used `aliascnt` to alias counters for propositions, definitions, etc. so that
  the `\autoref` command correctly names references to these environments
  (otherwise, the automatically generated names will all be "Theorem", since
  all theorem-like environments use the per-section theorem counter).
* Removed `\newcommand{\C}{{\mathbb C}}`, because the `\C` command is already
  defined in the `complexity` package.

## Compiling ##

To compile this article, run 

    pdflatex equivalence
    biber equivalence
    pdflatex equivalence

The output is `equivalence.pdf`.
