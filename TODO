* intermediary.tex: change L(P_i) to A_i and L(Q_i) to B_i?
* is it necessary to require polynomially clocked TM?
* given an arbitrary NPEq complete language in which some equivalence classes
  are finite, construct another language (polytime kernel reducible to it or
  from it) in which all equivalence classes are finite
