* intermediary.tex: change L(P_i) to A_i and L(Q_i) to B_i?
* is it necessary to require polynomially clocked TM?
* show that GI <_ker A (from thm:npeqcnpc), providing an upper bound in NPEq
* given an arbitrary NPEq complete language in which some equivalence classes
  are finite, construct another language (polytime kernel reducible to it or
  from it) in which all equivalence classes are finite
* with the previous point: construct NP equivalence relation from arbitrary
  graph property harder than isomorphism
* examine NP disjoint pairs: http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~selman/NPpairs.pdf
* and canonical proof systems:
