\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

If $f\colon S\to T$ is a well-defined function and $S'\subseteq S$, then \defn{$f$ restricted to the domain $S'$} is the function $f'\colon S'\to T$ defined by $f'(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in S'$.
We denote this restricted function on a smaller domain by $f|_{S'}$.

If $\Sigma$ is an alphabet then $\Sigma^*$ is the set of all strings over the alphabet $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma^{\leq n}$ is the set $\{w\in\Sigma^*|\,|w|\leq n\}$.
Usually $\Sigma$ is the binary alphabet $\{0, 1\}$.
The empty string will be denoted by $\lambda$.
If $\sigma\in\Sigma$ then $\sigma^k$ is the string consisting of $k$ concatenated copies of the symbol $\sigma$.
If $x$ and $y$ are elements of $\Sigma^*$, then we denote by $\pair{x}{y}$ the \defn{pairwise encoding} of $x$ and $y$, which is itself an element of $\Sigma^*$.
In this paper, we will assume the reasonable pairwise encoding defined by $\pair{x}{y}=x_1x_1x_2x_2\cdots x_{|x|}x_{|x|}01y_1y_1y_2y_2\cdots y_{|y|}y_{|y|}$ for all $x$ and $y$ in $\Sigma^*$.
As usual, a \defn{language} over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is a subset of $\Sigma^*$.
The \defn{complement} of a language $L$ is $\Sigma^*\backslash L$, and is denoted $\overline{L}$.

The complexity classes $\P$, $\NP$, $\FP$ (polynomial time computable functions), $\SKP$, $\PKP$, and $\PSPACE$ have the usual definitions.
The set of words accepted by a Turing machine $M$ is denoted $L(M)$.
The \defn{complement} of a complexity class $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of complements of languages in $\mathcal{C}$, and is denoted $\coC$.

We say a Turing machine $M$ is a \defn{polynomially clocked Turing machine} if the description of $M$ includes a positive integer $k$ such that $M$ halts within time $kn^k$ on all inputs of length $n$.

If $L_1, L_2$ are languages, we say that \defn{$L_1$ polynomial time many-one reduces to $L_2$} if there exists a polynomial time computable function $f$ such that $w\in L_1$ if and only if $f(w)\in L_2$.
We denote this by $L_1\mor L_2$.
If $L_1\mor L_2$ and $L_2\mor L_1$, we say that $L_1$ and $L_2$ are \defn{equivalent under polynomial time many-one reductions}, and denote this by $L_1\moe L_2$.

Given a universe $U$, $R\subseteq U\times U$ is an \defn{equivalence relation on $U$} if $R$ is
\begin{enumerate}
\item reflexive: for all $x\in U$, $(x,x)\in R$
\item symmetric: for all $x,y\in U$, $(x,y)\in R$ implies $(y,x)\in R$
\item transitive: for all $x,y,z\in U$, $(x,y)\in R$ and $(y,z)\in R$ implies $(x,z)\in R$
\end{enumerate}
An equivalence relation $R$ can be encoded as a language by taking the pairwise encoding of each pair in $R$.
In this way we can study the computational complexity of classes of languages which represent equivalence relations.
In this paper we will abuse notation and write $\pair{x}{y}\in R$ for an equivalence relation $R$ on $\Sigma^*$, but what we really mean is $(x,y)\in R$ and $\pair{x}{y}\in L_R$, the language on the alphabet $\Sigma$ induced by $R$.

The \defn{equivalence class} of $x$ with respect to an equivalence relation $R$ on $U$ is $\{y\in U|(x,y)\in R\}$. It is denoted $[x]_R$, or if the context is clear, simply $[x]$.
Each element $x\in U$ is in exactly one equivalence class, so the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on $U$ provide a partition of $U$.

A \defn{complete invariant} for an equivalence relation $R$ on $U$ is a function $f\colon U\to T$ such that for all $x,y\in U$, $(x,y)\in R$ if and only if $f(x)=f(y)$.
In \autoref{sec:definitions} we will define generalizations of the complete invariant which accept as input an additional witness to the equivalence of $x$ and $y$.

\defn{$\PEq$} is the class of equivalence relations for which membership can be decided by a Turing machine running in deterministic polynomial time.
\defn{$\NPEq$} is the class of equivalence relations for which membership can be decided by a Turing machine running in non-deterministic polynomial time.
In other words, $\PEq$ is the set of (languages induced by) equivalence relations which are in \P, and $\NPEq$ is the set of (languages induced by) equivalence relations which are in \NP.
In general, the class \defn{$\CEq$} is the class of languages induced by equivalence relations which are in the complexity class $\mathcal{C}$.
As usual, $\PEq\subseteq\NPEq$.
%\defn{$\Ker$} is the class of equivalence relations which have a polynomial time computable complete invariant.

We now require a natural notion of reduction among equivalence relations.
If $R$ and $S$ are equivalence relations on $\Sigma^*$, we say $R$ \defn{kernel reduces to} $S$ if there exists a computable $f\colon\Sigma^*\to\Sigma^*$ such that $\forall x,y\in\Sigma^*$, $\pair{x}{y}\in R\iff \pair{f(x)}{f(y)}\in S$.
We denote this by $R\krnt S$.
If $f$ is computable in polynomial time, then we say $R$ \defn{polynomial time kernel reduces to} $S$ and use the notation $R\kr S$.

Notice the difference between a kernel reduction and a regular old many-one reduction: a kernel reduction maps $\pair{x}{y}\in R$ to $\pair{f(x)}{f(y)}\in S$, whereas a many-one reduction maps $\pair{x}{y}\in R$ to $f(\pair{x}{y})\in S$, for some polynomial time computable function $f$.
Informally, a function which computes a many-one reduction has access to both $x$ and $y$ but a function which computes a kernel reduction has access to only one of $x$ and $y$ at a time.
Note that since it is more restrictive, a kernel reduction induces a many-one reduction (namely the function $\pair{x}{y}\mapsto\pair{f(x)}{f(y)}$).

As an analog to polynomial time many-one completeness in \NP, we define a similar notion of completeness under polynomial time kernel reductions in \NPEq.
An equivalence relation $S$ is \defn{\NPEq-hard} if for all $R\in\NPEq$, $R\kr S$.
If $S$ is also in \NPEq, then it is \defn{\NPEq-complete}.
If $S$ is \NPEq-complete, we sometimes say that $S$ is \defn{complete under $\kr$ reductions in \NPEq}.
Generally, an equivalence relation $S$ is \defn{$\CEq$-hard} if for all $R\in\CEq$, $R\kr S$, and \defn{$\CEq$-complete} if it is additionally in $\CEq$.
