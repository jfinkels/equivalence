\item Are there natural $\PSPACEEq$-complete problems?
\item Do existing complexity results concerning problems of equivalence using many-one reductions hold when using kernel reductions?
\item Under what general conditions does a complexity class have a complete problem under kernel reductions?
\item Can we construct problems which are hard under polynomial time kernel reductions for smaller or larger complexity classes?
\item \textbf{Does $\NPEq$ have a complete problem?}
\end{itemize}
