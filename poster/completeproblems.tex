\begin{theorem}
  Under polynomial time kernel reductions,
  \begin{enumerate}
  {\indentitem \item $\PSPACEEq$ has a complete problem}
  {\indentitem \item $\PKPOPEq$ contains a problem which is hard for $\SKPEq$, for all $k\geq 0$}
  {\indentitem \item $\PKPOPEq$ contains a problem which is hard for $\PKPEq$, for all $k\geq 0$}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proofidea}
  Turn the canonical complete problem for $\NP$,
  \begin{displaymath}
    K = \left\{(M, x, 1^t)\,\middle|\,M\text{ accepts } x \text{ within } t \text{ steps}\right\},
  \end{displaymath}
  into an equivalence relation, $R_K$, which relies on the hardness of $K$.
  Use a helper algorithm to enforce that the language of the machine $M$ is an equivalence relation (for strings up to a certain length).
  This helper algorithm bumps up the hardness of the problem to the next level of the polynomial time hierarchy.
