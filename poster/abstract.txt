Abstract:

In this paper, we examine a recently introduced type of effective reduction
which applies solely to problems of equivalence or isomorphism: the "kernel
reduction".  Specifically, we examine reductions among languages in the
complexity class consisting of all languages induced by equivalence relations
for which membership can be decided by a non-deterministic polynomial time
Turing machine.  This class is called "NPEq"; the definitions for PEq and
coNPEq are analagous.

We prove a general theorem which provides a problem which is hard under
polynomial time kernel reductions for several classes of equivalence relations,
including (Sigma_k)PEq and PSPACEEq.  In fact, such a problem is complete for
PSPACEEq under polynomial time kernel reductions.  We also show that if there
is a complete problem under kernel reductions in NPEq, then that problem is
also complete under many-one reductions in NP.  Finally we use a proof of
Ladner's theorem to show that if PEq does not equal NPEq and there are problems
in NPEq which are complete under polynomial time kernel reductions then there
are NPEq-intermediary problems---problems which are in NPEq, but not complete
under kernel reductions and not in PEq.
