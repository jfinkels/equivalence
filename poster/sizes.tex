\begin{theorem}
  If the number of equivalence classes of $R$ is superpolynomial and the number of equivalence classes of $S$ is polynomial, then $R$ does not polynomial time kernel reduce to $S$.
\end{theorem}
\vspace{1cm}
\begin{proofidea}
  All elements of a single equivalence class of $R$ must have images which are in the same equivalence class of $S$.
  If such a kernel reduction were to exist, the pigeonhole principle would force elements from two different equivalence classes of $R$ to be mapped to a single equivalence class of $S$.
\end{proofidea}
