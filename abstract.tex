In this paper we analyze the notion of kernel reductions among equivalence
problems, as defined in Fortnow and Grochow. We first examine what kernel
reductions look like, practically, among feasible equivalence problems. We next
provide some evidence that the restriction of a polynomial time kernel
reduction is not on the time complexity of the reduction, but on the number of
equivalence classes in the equivalence relations being reduced. We then examine
the graph isomorphism problem and problems equivalent to it under polynomial
time many-one reductions, and find that of these problems the ones which are
equivalence problems are in fact equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem
under polynomial time kernel reductions.
