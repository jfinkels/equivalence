\begin{proposition}\label{prop:compose}
  If $R\kr S$ and $S\kr T$ then $R\kr T$. In other words, polynomial time
  kernel reductions compose.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let $f$ and $g$ be the polynomial time kernel reductions from $R$ to $S$ and
  from $S$ to $T$, respectively. Then $g\circ f$ computes a polynomial time
  kernel reduction from $R$ to $T$. It is polynomial time computable because
  polynomial time computable functions compose, and $\pair{x}{y}\in R$ if and
  only if $\pair{f(x)}{f(y)}\in S$ if and only if $\pair{g(f(x))}{g(f(y))}\in
  T$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:numbers}
  Let $R$ and $S$ be equivalence relations on $\sigmastar$. Suppose $R$ has $n$
  equivalence classes and $S$ has $m$ equivalence classes. If $n>m$ then
  $R\nkrnt S$ (that is, $R$ does not kernel reduce to $S$, regardless of any
  time bound on the function computing the reduction).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Assume with the intention of producing a contradiction that $R\krnt S$. Then
  there exists a computable function $f$ such that $\forall x,y$,
  $\pair{x}{y}\in R\iff \pair{f(x)}{f(y)}\in S$.

  Since $R$ has $n$ non-empty equivalence classes which form a partition of
  $\sigmastar$, then $\exists r_1,\ldots,r_n\in\sigmastar$ such that
  $R=[r_1]_R\cup\cdots\cup[r_n]_R$.  Since each element of $R$ is in exactly
  one equivalence class, $\forall i,j\leq n$, $i=j\iff\pair{r_i}{r_j}\in
  R\iff\pair{f(r_i)}{f(r_j)}\in S$. Therefore the image of each $r_i$ is in
  some equivalence class in $S$.  Also, $\forall i,j\leq n$, $i\neq j\iff
  \pair{r_i}{r_j}\notin R\iff \pair{f(r_i)}{f(r_j)}\notin S$. Therefore, the
  image of each $r_i$ does not relate to the image of any other $r_j$, for
  $i\neq j$, and $i,j\leq n$. Therefore each of the equivalence classes
  $[f(r_1)]_S,\ldots,[f(r_n)]_S$ is disjoint, so $S$ has at least $n$
  equivalence classes. But $n>m$. This is a contradiction with the hypothesis
  that $S$ has $m$ equivalence classes.

  Therefore $R\nkrnt S$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:finite}
  \mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\roman{enumi}.}
  \item If an equivalence relation has a finite number of equivalence classes,
    then it is not \PEq-complete.
  \item If an equivalence relation has a finite number of equivalence classes,
    then it is not \NPEq-complete.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $R$ is an equivalence relation. Assume with the intention of
  producing a contradiction that $R$ is
  \PEq-complete. $R_{eq}=\{\pair{x}{y}|x=y\}$ has an infinite number of
  equivalence classes (specifically, one for each binary string), and $R$ has a
  finite number of equivalence classes, by assumption. By
  \autoref{thm:numbers}, $R\nkr R_{eq}$. But since $R_{eq}\in\PEq$, then
  $R_{eq}\kr R$. This is a contradiction. Therefore $R$ is not \PEq-complete.

  The proof is the same in \NPEq, because $R_{eq}\in\PEq\subseteq\NPEq$.
\end{proof}

%% TODO extend this theorem to countably infinite sets
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:repr_kr}
  Let $R,S$ be equivalence relations on $\sigmastar$. Suppose
  $R\in\PEq$. Suppose also that $R$ has $n$ equivalence classes and the number
  of equivalence classes of $S$ is greater than or equal to $n$ (possibly
  countably infinite). Let $REP(R)$ be a set of representatives of equivalence
  classes in $R$, and $REP(S)$ be a set of representatives of equivalence
  classes in $S$. If there exists a function $f\colon REP(R)\to REP(S)$ such
  that $f\in\FP$ and $f$ is injective, then $R\kr S$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Since $R\in\PEq$, $\exists M_R$, a deterministic Turing machine running in
  polynomial time, such that $\pair{x}{y}\in R\iff M_R(\pair{x}{y})$
  accepts. Construct $g\in\FP$ on input $w\in\sigmastar$:\\
  \begin{algorithm}[H]
    \For{$r_i\in REP(R)$}{
      \If{$M_R(\pair{w}{r_i})$ accepts}{
        \Return{$f(r_i)$}
      }
    }
  \end{algorithm}
  Notice that each $w\in\sigmastar$ is in exactly one equivalence class in $R$,
  because the equivalence classes partition $\sigmastar$, so
  $M_R(\pair{w}{r_i})$ accepts exactly once during the loop, when
  $\pair{w}{r_i}\in R$.

  Suppose $\pair{x}{y}\in R$, so $\pair{x}{r_i}\in R$ and $\pair{y}{r_i}\in R$
  for some $r_i\in REP(R)$. Then $g(x)$ outputs $f(r_i)$ and $g(y)$ outputs
  $f(r_i)$. Since $\pair{f(r_i)}{f(r_i)}\in S$, then $\pair{g(x)}{g(y)}\in S$.

  Suppose $\pair{x}{y}\notin R$. So $\exists r_i, r_j\in REP(R)$, with $r_i\neq
  r_j$, such that $\pair{x}{r_i}\in R$ and $\pair{y}{r_j}\in R$. Then $g(x)$
  outputs $f(r_i)$ and $g(y)$ outputs $f(r_j)$. Since $f$ is injective,
  $r_i\neq r_j\implies f(r_i)\neq f(r_j)$. Since $f(r_i)$ and $f(r_j)$ are
  distinct elements in $REP(S)$, they are representatives of two distinct
  equivalence classes. Since every element of $S$ is in exactly one equivalence
  class, and since $[f(r_i)]\neq[f(r_j)]$, it follows that
  $\pair{f(r_i)}{f(r_j)}=\pair{g(x)}{g(y)}\notin S$.

  Therefore $\pair{x}{y}\in R\iff \pair{g(x)}{g(y)}\in S$, so $R\kr S$.
\end{proof}

%% TODO define computably enumerable
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:reps}
  Let $R,S$ be equivalence relations on $\sigmastar$. Suppose
  $R\in\PEq$. Suppose also that $R$ has $n$ equivalence classes and the number
  of equivalence classes of $S$ is greater than or equal to $n$ (possibly
  countably infinite). Let $REP(R)$ be a set of representatives of equivalence
  classes in $R$, and $REP(S)$ be a set of representatives of equivalence
  classes in $S$. If $REP(R)$ and $REP(S)$ are computably enumerable then $R\kr
  S$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We compute the kernel reduction using the following procedure.

  Enumerate $REP(R)$ to produce $\{r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n\}$, where each $r_i$
  is a representative of a distinct equivalence class of $R$. Enumerate
  $REP(S)$ to produce $\{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$, where each $s_i$ is a
  representative of a distinct equivalence class of $S$. Note that we only need
  to output representatives of $n$ equivalence classes of $S$ though it may
  have more.

  Define $f\in\FP$ by $f(r_i)=s_i$, $\forall i\leq n$. We now wish to show that
  $f$ is injective. Suppose $r_i,r_j\in R$ and $r_i\neq r_j$. Then $f(r_i)=s_i$
  and $f(r_j)=s_j$. $r_i\neq r_j\implies i\neq j\implies s_i\neq s_j\implies
  f(s_i)\neq f(s_j)$. Therefore $f$ is injective.

  The function $f$ now satisfies the conditions in the hypothesis of
  \autoref{thm:repr_kr}, so the result follows.
\end{proof}

Note that computing the representatives of $R$ and $S$ takes some amount of
time \emph{independent} of the size of the input to the transducer $f$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:image}
  Let $R,S$ be equivalence relations on $\sigmastar$, and let
  $w\in\sigmastar$. Suppose $R\kr S$, by some $f\in\FP$. Then
  $f([w]_R)\subseteq [f(w)]_S$. In other words, the image of an equivalence
  class of $R$ is a subset of an equivalence class of $S$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Since $w\in [w]_R$, $f(w)\in f([w]_R)$. Let $x\in f([w]_R)$. Then $(x,
  f(w))\in S$, so $x\in [f(w)]_S$. Therefore $f([w]_R)\subseteq [f(w)]_S$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  There exists an \NP-complete language $A$ such that if $A$ is $\kr$-complete
  in $\NPEq$, then $A$ is not $\kri$-complete in $\NPEq$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $A=\{\pair{\pair{G_1}{k_1}}{\pair{G_2}{k_2}}| k_1=k_2$ and $(G_1\cong
  G_2$ or $(G_1$ has a clique of size $k_1$ and $G_2$ has a clique of size
  $k_2$ and $|V_1|=|V_2|))\}$, where $G_1=(V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2=(V_2, E_2)$. The
  only difference between this equivalence relation and $R_{KC}$ is the
  condition that $G_1$ and $G_2$ must have the same number of vertices.

  $A$ is $\mor$-complete in $\NP$ by a reduction from $CLIQUE$ similar to the
  one in \autoref{thm:rkc_npc}.  If $G=(V,E)$, we can compute in polynomial
  time the reduction $f$ defined by
  $\pair{G}{k}\mapsto\pair{\pair{G}{k}}{\pair{K^+_k}{k}}$, where $K^+_k$ is the
  complete graph of $k$ vertices with $|V|-k$ vertices added (without any
  connecting edges), if $|V|\geq k$. If $|V|<k$, then $K^+_k=K_k$. To show $f$
  is a many-one reduction from $CLIQUE$, first suppose $\pair{G}{k}\in CLIQUE$,
  so $G$ has a clique of size $k$, which implies $|V|\geq k$. Hence, $G$ has a
  clique of size $k$, $K^+_k$ has a clique of size $k$, and $|V|$ equals the
  number of vertices in $K^+_k$ (by construction). Therefore
  $\pair{\pair{G}{k}}{\pair{K^+_k}{k}}\in A$. Suppose $\pair{G}{k}\notin
  CLIQUE$, so $G$ does not have a clique of size $k$. $K^+_k$ has a clique of
  size $k$ by definition, so the only case left to check is whether $G$ is
  isomorphic to $K^+_k$. If they were isomorphic, then $G$ would have a clique
  of size $k$, but this is a contradiction with the hypothesis, so
  $\pair{\pair{G}{k}}{\pair{K^+_k}{k}}\notin A$. Therefore $CLIQUE\mor A$, and
  hence $A$ is $\mor$-complete in $\NP$.

  Now, we will consider the equivalence classes in the equivalence relation
  $R_{bc}$, as defined in \autoref{def:rbc}. There are an infinite number of
  equivalence classes in $R_{bc}$; specifically, they are $[\lambda], [1],
  [11], [111],$ etc. Each equivalence class is itself infinite as well: if
  $w\in\sigmastar$ then $[w]$ contains $w, 0w, 00w, 000w,$ etc.

  % TODO is the number of n vertex graphs correct?

  Next, we will consider the equivalence classes in $A$. There are an infinite
  number of equivalence classes in $A$, as well (because there are an infinite
  number of graphs, and an infinite number of natural numbers). However, in $A$
  each equivalence class contains only a finite number of elements. If
  $G=(V,E)$, then $[\pair{G}{k}]$ includes all pairs $\pair{H}{k}$, where $G$
  is isomorphic to $H$, and all pairs $\pair{J}{k}$, where $G$ and $J$ have the
  same number of vertices and both have a clique of size $k$. Since there are
  only a finite number of graphs on $|V|$ vertices, and any graph isomorphic to
  $G$ must have $|V|$ vertices, the number of graphs isomorphic to $G$ is
  finite. Furthermore, the number of graphs with both $|V|$ vertices and a
  clique of size $k$ is also finite. Therefore, the equivalence class
  $[\pair{G}{k}]$ is finite.

  Now suppose $A$ is $\kr$-complete in $\NPEq$, as specified in the hypothesis
  of this theorem. Since $R_{bc}\in\PEq\subseteq\NPEq$, then $R_{bc}\kr A$, so
  $\exists f\in\FP$ such that $w\in\R_{bc}\iff f(w)\in A$.

  Let $w\in\sigmastar$. Then $f(w)=\pair{G}{k}$ for some graph $G$ and some
  $k\in\mathbb{N}$. By the above arguments, $[w]_{R_{bc}}$ is infinite and
  $[f(w)]_A=[\pair{G}{k}]_A$ is finite. By \autoref{lem:image},
  $f([w]_{R_{bc}})\subseteq [f(w)]_A$. Consider $f|_{[w]_{R_{bc}}}$, that is,
  $f$ restricted to the domain $[w]_{R_{bc}}$. Then $f|_{[w]_{R_{bc}}}$ is a
  mapping from an infinite set (specifically $[w]_{R_{bc}}$) to a finite set
  (specifically $[f(w)]_A=[\pair{G}{k}]_A$). By the pigeonhole principle,
  $f|_{[w]_{R_{bc}}}$ is not injective. Hence the unrestricted reduction $f$ is
  not injective, and therefore $A$ is not $\kri$-complete in \NPEq.
\end{proof}

\section{Analog of Ladner's theorem}

\begin{definition}
  A class of languages $\mathcal{C}$ is \defn{closed under finite variations}
  if and only if $A\in \mathcal{C}$ and $A\symdiff B$ is finite implies $B\in
  \mathcal{C}$ for all $B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Given an alphabet $\Sigma$ with at least two different symbols, say $0$ and
  $1$, the \defn{kernel join} of two equivalence relations $R$ and $S$ over
  $\Sigma^*$ is $R\kj S=\{\pair{x0}{y0}|\pair{x}{y}\in
  R\}\cup\{\pair{x1}{y1}|\pair{x}{y}\in S\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  If $R$ and $S$ are equivalence relations on $\Sigma^*$, then $R\kj S$ is an
  equivalence relation.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  %% TODO Are non-empty strings okay?

  Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ be non-empty strings in $\Sigma^*$.
  
  Since $x$ is non-empty, $x=x'0$ or $x=x'1$. Since $R$ is reflexive,
  $\pair{x'}{x'}\in R$. Hence $\pair{x}{x}\in R\kj S$. Therefore $R\kj S$ is
  reflexive.
  
  Suppose $\pair{x}{y}\in R\kj S$. Then either $x=x'0$, $y=y'0$ and
  $\pair{x'}{y'}\in R$ or $x=x'1$, $y=y'1$ and $\pair{x'}{y'}\in S$. In either
  case, symmetry follows from the symmetry of $R$ or $S$.

  Suppose $\pair{x}{y}$ and $\pair{y}{z}$ are both in $R\kj S$. In the case
  that $x=x'0$, $y=y'0$ and $\pair{x'}{y'}\in R$, and that $z=z'0$ and
  $\pair{y'}{z'}\in R$, then by the transitivity of $R$, $\pair{x'}{z'}\in R$,
  so $\pair{x}{z}\in R\kj S$. The argument is similar in the case that $x=x'1$,
  $y=y'1$ and $z=z'1$. It is a contradiction for the other two cases to exist,
  since $y$ cannot be equal to both $y'0$ and $y'1$.

  Since $R\kj S$ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, $R\kj S$ is an
  equivalence relation.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:symdiff}
  Symmetric difference of equivalence relations preserves symmetry.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let $R$ and $S$ be equivalence relations. Let $(x,y)\in(R\symdiff S)$. In
  the case that $(x,y)\in R$ and $(x,y)\notin S$, then $(y,x)\in R$. If $(y,x)$
  were in $S$, then $(x,y)$ would also be in $S$, by symmetry, but this is a
  contradiction. Hence $(y,x)\in R$ and $(y,x)\notin S$. The argument for the
  other case is symmetric. Therefore $(x,y)\in(R\symdiff S)\implies
  (y,x)\in(R\symdiff S)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Let $r\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ be a computable function such that
  $r(m)>m$ for all $m$. Define the set $G[r]$ as
  \begin{displaymath}
    G[r]=\{x\in\Sigma^*|r^n(0)\leq|x|<r^{n+1}(0) \plain{for some even} n\}
  \end{displaymath}
  where $r^n(m)$ denotes the $n$-fold application of $r$ to $m$:
  \begin{displaymath}
    \overbrace{r\circ r\circ r\circ\cdots\circ r}^{n \text{times}}(m)
  \end{displaymath}
  $G[r]$ is called the \defn{gap language} generated by $r$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:gap_p}
  If $r$ is time constructible, then $G[r]\in\P$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

We will denote the Cartesian product $G[r]\times G[r]$ by the slightly more
succinct ${G[r]}^2$, and $\overline{G[r]}\times\overline{G[r]}$ by
$\overline{G[r]}^2$. Elements of ${G[r]}^2$ are pairs of strings whose lengths
are in the ``even gaps'' of $r$, while elements of $\overline{G[r]}^2$ are
pairs of strings whose lengths are in the ``odd gaps'' of $r$.

\begin{lemma}
  ${G[r]}^2$ and $\overline{G[r]}^2$ are partial equivalence relations (that
  is, they are symmetric and transitive).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We will prove the theorem for ${G[r]}^2$; a symmetric argument proves the
  theorem for $\overline{G[r]}^2$.

  Let $x,y\in\Sigma^*$. Suppose $\pair{x}{y}\in {G[r]}^2$, so the lengths of
  $x$ and $y$ are both in an even gap of $r$. Then $\pair{y}{x}\in{G[r]}^2$, so
  ${G[r]}^2$ is symmetric. Now let $z\in\Sigma^*$ and suppose also that
  $\pair{y}{z}\in {G[r]}^2$. Then $y$ and $z$ are both in an even gap of $r$,
  so $x$, $y$ and $z$ are all in some even gap of $r$, and hence
  $\pair{x}{z}\in {G[r]}^2$. Therefore ${G[r]}^2$ is transitive.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:diag}
  Let $R_1$ and $R_2$ be decidable equivalence relations, and let
  $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ be classes of decidable equivalence
  relations such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $R_1\notin\mathcal{C}_1$
  \item $R_2\notin\mathcal{C}_2$
  \item $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are computably enumerable
  \item $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are closed under finite variations
  \end{enumerate}
  Then there exists a decidable equivalence relation $R$ such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $R\notin \mathcal{C}_1$
  \item $R\notin \mathcal{C}_2$
  \item $R\kr R_1\kj R_2$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} %% TODO use \pair command for pairs
  Let $P_1, P_2, \ldots$ and $Q_1, Q_2, \ldots$ be enumerations of Turing
  machines deciding the languages in $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$
  respectively. Define the functions
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    r_1(n)=\underset{i\leq n}{max}\{|z_{i,n}|\}+1 & \text{and} &
    r_2(n)=\underset{i\leq n}{max}\{|z'_{i,n}|\}+1
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $z_{i,n}$ is the smallest word in $\Sigma^*$ such that there exists an
  $x\in\Sigma^*$, with $n<|x|\leq|z_{i,n}|$, such that $(z_{i,n},
  x)\in(L(P_i)\symdiff R_1)$, and $z'_{i,n}$ is the smallest word in $\Sigma^*$
  such that there exists an $x'\in\Sigma^*$, with $n<|x'|\leq|z'_{i,n}|$, such
  that $(z'_{i,n}, x')\in(L(Q_i)\symdiff R_2)$. Note that it also suffices to
  find an $x$ and $x'$ such that $(x, z_{i,n})\in(L(P_i)\symdiff R_1)$ and
  $(x', z'_{i,n})\in(L(Q_i)\symdiff R_2)$, since symmetric difference on
  equivalence relations preserves symmetry by \autoref{prop:symdiff}.

  We claim that $z_{i,n}$ and $z'_{i,n}$ always exist. Assume that no such
  $z_{i,n}$ exists, so there are no words such that there exists an
  $x\in\Sigma^*$, with $n<|x|\leq|z_{i,n}|$, such that $(z_{i,n},
  x)\in(L(P_i)\symdiff R_1)$. Therefore, there are no pairs in $(L(P_i)\symdiff
  R_1)$ with both elements of length greater than $n$. Then there are a finite
  number of pairs in $L(P_i)\symdiff R_1$, so $R_1$ is a finite variation of
  $L(P_i)$. Since $\mathcal{C}_1$ is closed under finite variations,
  $R_1\in\mathcal{C}_1$. This is a contradiction with the hypothesis that
  $R_1\notin\mathcal{C}_1$. Therefore such a $z_{i,n}$ always exists. The
  argument that $z'_{i,n}$ always exists is similar.

  Since $L(P_i)$ and $L(Q_i)$ are decidable for all $i$, and since $R_1$ and
  $R_2$ are decidable, so are $L(P_i)\symdiff R_1$ and $L(Q_i)\symdiff
  R_2$. For each $n$, there is a procedure which always halts and which
  computes $z_{i,n}$ (using a sort of linear search). A similar procedure
  computes $z'_{i,n}$. The procedure which computes the maximum of a finite set
  of numbers and which adds one to that value always halts as well, so $r_1$
  and $r_2$ are total computable functions.

  Let $r\ge max(r_1,r_2)$ be a non-decreasing time constructible function,
  which exists by \autoref{nondec}. Now for all $n$ and all $i\leq n$, each
  element of the pairs $(z_{i,n},x)$ have length between $n$ and $r_1(n)$, by
  construction. The same is true for $(z'_{i,n}, x')$ between $n$ and
  $r_2(n)$. Notice that $(z_{i,n}, x)$ and $(z'_{i,n}, x')$ are ``witnesses''
  that $R_1\neq L(P_i)$ and $R_2\neq L(Q_i)$ respectively. Hence for all $n$,
  there are some witnesses between $n$ and $r(n)$ that for all $i\leq n$,
  $R_1\neq L(P_i)$ and $R_2\neq L(Q_i)$.

  Define $R=({G[r]}^2\cap R_1)\cup(\overline{G[r]}^2\cap R_2)$, so $R$ is equal
  to pairs of $R_1$ in the ``even gaps'' of r and $R$ is equal to pairs of
  $R_2$ in the ``odd gaps'' of $r$. It remains to show that $R$ is an
  equivalence relation which satisfies the properties stated in the theorem.

  First we show that $R$ is indeed an equivalence relation. Symmetry and
  transitivity follow from the symmetry and transitivity of $R_1$, $R_2$,
  ${G[r]}^2$ and ${G[r]}^2$. To show reflexivity, suppose $x\in G[r]$. Hence
  $\pair{x}{x}\in {G[r]}^2$. Since $R_1$ is an equivalence relation,
  $\pair{x}{x}\in R_1$. Therefore $\pair{x}{x}\in({G[r]}^2\cap R_1)$, so
  $\pair{x}{x}\in R$. The argument for the case that $x\in\overline{G[r]}$ is
  similar. Therefore $R$ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

  Next we show that $R\notin\mathcal{C}_1$. The argument which proves
  $R\notin\mathcal{C}_2$ is symmetric. Assume $R\in\mathcal{C}_1$ in order to
  produce a contradiction. Then there exists an $i$ such that $R=L(P_i)$. Let
  $m$ be an even integer such that $r^m(0)\geq i$. By construction, there
  exists a pair $\pair{x}{z}$ such that $r^m(0)\leq|x|\leq|z|<r^{m+1}(0)$ and
  $\pair{x}{z}\in(L(P_i)\symdiff R_1)$. Since $m$ is even, $\pair{x}{z}\in
  {G[r]}^2$. Since $R$ is equal to $R_1$ where it coincides with ${G[r]}^2$,
  then $\pair{x}{z}\in(L(P_i)\symdiff R)$. This is a contradiction with the
  hypothesis that $R=L(P_i)$. Therefore $R\notin\mathcal{C}_1$.

  Finally, we show that $R\kr R_1\kj R_2$. Since $G[r]\in\P$ by
  \autoref{lem:gap_p}, the function defined by
  \begin{displaymath}
    f(x)=
    \begin{cases}
      x0 & \text{if}\, x\in G[r]\\
      x1 & \text{if}\, x\notin G[r]\\
    \end{cases}
  \end{displaymath}
  is a polynomial time computable function.

  To show that $f$ computes the reduction from $R$ to $R_1\kj R_2$ correctly,
  suppose first that $\pair{x}{y}\in R$, so $\pair{x}{y}$ is in either
  $({G[r]}^2\cap R_1)$ or $\overline{G[r]}^2\cap R_2)$. In the former case,
  both $x$ and $y$ are in $G[r]$, so $f(x)=x0$ and $f(y)=y0$, and both $x$ and
  $y$ are in $R_1$, so $\pair{x0}{y0}=\pair{f(x)}{f(y)}\in R_1$. The argument
  for the latter case is symmetric.

  For the converse, suppose $\pair{f(x)}{f(y)}\in R_1\kj R_2$. Then $f(x)$ and
  $f(y)$ either both end with $0$ or both end with $1$. In the case that both
  end with $0$, then there exist some strings $w_x$ and $w_y$ such that
  $f(x)=w_x0$, $f(y)=w_y0$ and $\pair{w_x}{w_y}\in R_1$. By construction of
  $f$, $w_x$ must equal the input $x$ and $w_y$ must equal the input $y$, so
  $\pair{x}{y}\in R_1$. Also by construction, $f(x)=x0$ if and only if $x\in
  G[x]$ and $f(y)=y0$ if and only if $y\in G[x]$, so
  $\pair{x}{y}\in{G[r]}^2$. Hence $\pair{x}{y}\in({G[r]}^2\cap R_1\subseteq
  R$. The argument for the case that both $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ end with $1$ is
  symmetric, and shows that $\pair{x}{y}\in(\overline{G[r]}^2\cap R_2)\subseteq
  R$. Therefore $\pair{x}{y}\in R$ if and only if $\pair{f(x)}{f(y)}\in R_1\kj
  R_2$, so $f$ correctly computes the reduction from $R$ to $R_1\kj R_2$.

  Since we have shown that the equivalence relation $R$ satisfies the
  properties in the statement of the theorem, this concludes the proof.

\begin{proposition}
  \mbox{} % to put the next item on a new line
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \PEq is computably enumerable.
  \item The set of equivalence relations which are $\kr$-complete for \NPEq is
    computably enumerable.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

We will denote \NPEqC the set of equivalence relations which are $\kr$-complete
for \NPEq.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:npeqc}
  If $\PEq\neq\NPEq$ and \NPEqC is non-empty, then $\PEq\cap\NPEqC=\emptyset$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Assume $\PEq\cap\NPEqC\neq\emptyset$. Let $R$ be the \NPEq-complete
  equivalence relation which is also in \PEq. Then all problems can be kernel
  reduced to $R$ in polynomial time, and $R$ can be decided in polynomial
  time. Therefore, $\PEq=\NPEq$. This is a contradiction with the
  hypothesis. Therefore $\PEq\cap\NPEqC=\emptyset$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  If $\PEq\neq\NPEq$ and \NPEqC is non-empty, then there exists an equivalence
  relation in \NPEq which is neither in \PEq nor \NPEqC.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The hypothesis of this theorem is the same as in \autoref{thm:npeqc}, so
  $\PEq\cap\NPEqC=\emptyset$. Let $S$ be an \NPEq-complete problem. Choose
  $R_1=S$, $R_2=\emptyset$, $\mathcal{C}_1=\PEq$ and
  $\mathcal{C}_2=\NPEqC$. Then by \autoref{thm:diag}, there exists an
  equivalence relation $R$ which is in neither \NPEqC nor \PEq, but which
  kernel reduces to $S\kj\emptyset$. Since $S\kj\emptyset$ trivially kernel
  reduces to $S$, and since polynomial time kernel reductions compose by
  \autoref{prop:compose}, $R\kr S$. Since \NPEq is closed under polynomial time
  kernel reductions, $R\in\NPEq$.
