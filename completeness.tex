\begin{lemma}\label{lem:rl_eq_rel}Let $L\in\NP$, and let $N$ be the
  non-deterministic polynomial-time machine that decides $L$.  Then
  $R_L=\{(x,y)|x=y \plain{or} N(x\oplus y) \plain{accepts}\}$ is an equivalence
  relation in \NPEq.\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}To show that $R_L$ is an equivalence relation, we must show that
  $R_L$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
  
  Since $x=x$, $(x,x)\in R_L$, so $R_L$ is reflexive.

  To show $R_L$ is symmetric, consider $(x,y)\in R_L$. In the case that $x=y$,
  then $y=x$ because the equality relation is symmetric, so $(y,x)\in R_L$. In
  the case that $N(x\oplus y)$ accepts, then $V(y\oplus x)$ accepts, because
  $\oplus$ is commutative, so $(y,x)\in R_L$.

  To show $R_L$ is transitive, let $(x,y),(y,z)\in R_L$. In the case that $x=y$
  and $y=z$, then $x=z$ by the transitivity of the equality relation, so
  $(x,z)\in R_L$. In the case that $x=y$ and $N(y\oplus z)$ accepts, then
  $N(x\oplus z)$ accepts, so $(x,z)\in R_L$. In the case that $N( x\oplus y)$
  and $y=z$, then $N(x\oplus z)$ accepts, so $(x,z)\in R_L$. In the case that
  $N(x\oplus y)$ accepts and $N(y\oplus z)$ accepts and $x\neq y$ and $y\neq
  z$, if $x=z$ then $(x,z)\in R_L$. If $x\neq z$, let $c_1=x\oplus y$ and let
  $c_2=y\oplus z$. Then $c_1\oplus c_2=x\oplus y\oplus y\oplus z=x\oplus z$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:krc_npc}If a language $A$ is $\kr$-complete in \NPEq,
  then $A$ is $\mor$-complete in \NP. In other words, if $A$ is \NPEq-complete
  then $A$ is \NP-complete.\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $L\in\NP$, so there exists a non-deterministic polynomial-time machine,
  $N$, which decides $L$, that is, $w\in L\iff N(w)$ accepts. Define
  $R_L=\{(x,y)|x=y \plain{or} N(x\oplus y) \plain{accepts}\}$. $R_L$ is an
  equivalence relation in $\NPEq$ by \autoref{lem:rl_eq_rel}. Since $A$ is
  $\kr$-complete in \NPEq, $R_L\kr A$, so $\exists f\in\FP:(x,y)\in R_L\iff
  (f(x), f(y))\in A$.

  Construct $M\in\FP$ on input $w$:\\
  \begin{algorithm}[H]
    $x\gets0^{|w|-1}1$\;
    $y\gets w\oplus x$\;
    \Return{$(f(x),f(y))$}
  \end{algorithm}

  Suppose $w\in L$, so $N(w)$ accepts. Since $x\oplus y=w$ by construction,
  $N(x\oplus y)$ accepts. Hence $(x,y)\in R_L$, and $(f(x),f(y))\in A$, since
  $A$ is $\kr$-complete in \NPEq. Since $M(w)=(f(x),f(y))$ by construction,
  $M(w)\in A$.
  
  Suppose $w\notin L$ so $N(w)$ does not accept. Since $x\oplus y=w$,
  $N(x\oplus y)$ does not accept, so $(x,y)\notin R_L$ and since $A$ is
  $\kr$-complete in \NPEq, $(f(x), f(y))\notin A$. Since $M(w)=(f(x),f(y))$ by
  construction, $M(w)\notin A$.

  Therefore $w\in L\iff M(w)\in A$, therefore $A$ is $\mor$-complete in \NP,
  or in other words, $A$ is \NP-complete.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:gi_complete}If $GI$ is not $\mor$-complete in
  \NP\,then $GI$ is not $\kr$-complete in \NPEq. In other words, if $GI$ is not
  \NP-complete then $GI$ is not \NPEq-complete.\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  This is a specific case of the contrapositive statement of
  \autoref{thm:krc_npc}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:kr_mor}If $A\kr B$ then $A\mor B$.\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}Since $A\kr B$, $\exists f\in\FP: (x,y)\in A\iff(f(x), f(y))\in
  B$. Define $g\in FP$ by $g(x,y)=(f(x), f(y))$. Therefore $A\mor B$ by
  $g$.\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:np_closed}$\NP$ is closed under polynomial-time,
  many-one reductions. In other words, if $A\mor B$ and $B\in\NP$ then
  $A\in\NP$.\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Since $B\in\NP$, there exists a non-deterministic polynomial time Turing
  machine which decides $B$; call it $N_B$. Since $A\mor B$, $\exists f\in\FP$,
  such that $w\in A\iff f(w)\in B$. Construct non-deterministic Turing machine
  $N_A$ on input $w$:\\
  \begin{algorithm}[H]
    Compute $f(w)$\;
    Run $N_B$ on input $f(w)$\;
    \lIf{$N_B(f(w))$ accepts}{\ACCEPT}\;
    \lElse{\REJECT}\;
  \end{algorithm}
  Since $f$ runs in polynomial time and $N_B$ runs in non-deterministic
  polynomial time, $N_A$ runs in non-deterministic polynomial time. Therefore
  $A\in\NP$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:npeq_closed}$\NPEq$ is closed under polynomial time
  kernel reductions. In other words, if $R$ and $S$ are equivalence relations,
  such that $R\kr S$ and $S\in\NPEq$, then $R\in\NPEq$.\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}Suppose $S\in\NPEq$ and $R\kr S$. By \autoref{lem:kr_mor},
  $R\mor S$. Since $S\in\NPEq\subset\NP$ and $R\mor S$, then $R\in\NP$ by
  \autoref{lem:np_closed}. Since $R$ is an equivalence relation which can be
  decided in non-deterministic polynomial time, it is by definition in \NPEq.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:gi_classes}$\GIker$ is the class of problems
  which are polynomial-time equivalent under kernel reductions to $GI$. In
  other words, $\GIker=\{A|A\kequiv GI\}$.

  $\GIm$ is the class of problems which are polynomial-time, many-one
  equivalent to $GI$. In other words, $\GIm=\{A|A\moequiv GI\}$.

  $\GIt$ is the class of problems which are polynomial-time equivalent under
  Turing reductions to $GI$. In other words, $\GIt=\{A|A\tequiv GI\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:giker_neq_npeq}If $GI$ is not \NP-complete then
  $\GIker\neq\NPEq$.\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose $GI$ is not \NP-complete. By \autoref{cor:gi_complete}, $GI$ is not
  \NPEq-complete. Assume $\GIker=\NPEq$. By \autoref{def:gi_classes}, $GI$ is
  complete under kernel reductions in $\GIker$. Hence $GI$ is complete under
  kernel reductions in \NPEq, or in other words, $GI$ is \NPEq-complete. This
  is a contradiction. Therefore $\GIker\neq\NPEq$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}If $GI$ is not \NP-complete then
  $\GIker\subsetneq\NPEq$\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}Let $A\in\GIker$. By \autoref{cor:npeq_closed}, since $A\kr
  GI$ by definition of $\GIker$ and since $GI\in\NPEq$, $A\in\NPEq$. Hence
  $\GIker\subset\NPEq$. By \autoref{thm:giker_neq_npeq}, if $GI$ is not
  \NP-complete then $\GIker\neq\NPEq$. Therefore
  $\GIker\subsetneq\NPEq$.\end{proof}

Now the question is where does $\GIm$ live? There exist exotic problems which
are not equivalence problems, but which are polynomial-time many-one equivalent
to the graph isomorphism problem. For example, Kozen's M-tree clique problem,
the problem of recognizing a legitimate regular deck, and the problem of
recognizing a self-complementary graph are \emph{not} equivalence problems, but
they are indeed polynomial-time many-one equivalent to the graph isomorphism
problem. Since they are not equivalence relations, they certainly cannot be
kernel reduced to graph isomorphism, so $\GIk\subsetneq\GIm$.
%% TODO references

The next question is are there equivalence relations which many-one reduce to
graph isomorphism but which do not kernel reduce to graph isomorphism?
Informally, the question asks if there is some reduction relations such that
the reduction \emph{requires} information about both elements in each pair
(because a many-one reduction gets access to both elements $x$ and $y$ when
$(x,y)\in R$ whereas a kernel reduction gets access only to one at a time). In
fact, the problem of recognizing a self-complementary graph, when expressed as
an equivalence relation, may be a candidate for such a problem.

Examining most of the other problems in the class $\GIm$ reveals that nearly
all other (known) reductions can be expressed as kernel reductions. Many of the
techniques involve either edge replacement or composition of graphs, which can
both be performed on either graph without knowledge of the other. However, the
self-complementary graph problem, which is $SCGI=\{G|G \plain{is isomorphic to}
\bar{G}\}$, does not seem to have this property. Note that this set can be
alternately defined as an equivalence relation, $SCGI=\{(G_1,
G_2)|G_1=\bar{G_2} or \}$.
