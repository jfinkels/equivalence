In the framework of computational complexity, and in an effort to define
a more natural reduction for problems of equivalence, we investigate the
recently introduced kernel reduction, a reduction that operates on each
element of a pair independently. This paper details the limitations and
uses of kernel reductions. We show that kernel reductions are weaker
than many-one reductions and provide conditions under which complete
problems exist. Ultimately, the number and size of equivalence classes
can dictate the existence of a kernel reduction. We leave unsolved the
unconditional existence of a complete problem under polynomial-time
kernel reductions for the standard complexity classes.
