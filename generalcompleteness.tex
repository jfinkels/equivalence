\section{Conditions for complete problems under polynomial time kernel reductions}
\label{sec:generalcompleteness}

In this section we use the techniques of \autocite[Theorem~8.7]{bcffm} to present a general theorem which provides equivalence relations which are hard for a number of interesting complexity classes under polynomial time kernel reductions.
We need one additional definition here.
If $\mathcal{C}$ is a complexity class then the class $\forall\mathcal{C}$ is the set of languages $A$ such that there exists a language $B\in\mathcal{C}$ and a polynomial $p$ satisfying $x\in A$ if and only if $\forall w\in\Sigma^{\leq p(|x|)} \pair{x}{w}\in B$.
$\forall\mathcal{C}$ is called the \defn{closure of $\mathcal{C}$ under polynomially bounded universal quantification}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:generalcompleteness}
  Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a subset of $\PSPACE$ which contains the problem of deciding whether two strings are equal.
  Then there exists an equivalence relation in $\CRAZYEq$ which is hard for $\CEq$ under $\kr$ reductions.
\end{theorem}

Before proving this theorem, we will provide some immediate corollaries of this general result.

\begin{corollary}
  If $\mathcal{C}$ is a subset of $\PSPACE$ and $\mathcal{C}=\CRAZY$, then $\CEq$ has a complete problem under $\kr$ reductions.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:hardproblems}
  Under polynomial time kernel reductions,
  \begin{enumerate}
  %\item $\EXPEq$ has a complete problem
  \item $\PSPACEEq$ has a complete problem
  \item $\PKPEq$ contains a problem that is hard for $\DKPEq$, for all $k \geq 1$
  %\item\label{itm:hardforsigma} $\PKPOPEq$ contains a problem which is hard for $\SKPEq$, for all $k\geq 0$
  %\item $\PKPOPEq$ contains a problem which is hard for $\PKPEq$, for all $k\geq 0$
  %\item $\coNPEq$ contains a problem which is hard for $\PEq$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}\mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
  %\item $\EXP$ is closed under complement (because it is a deterministic complexity class) and polynomially bounded universal quantification (because we can simulate the universal guess deterministically in exponential time).
  \item $\PSPACE$ is closed under complement (because it is a deterministic complexity class) and polynomially bounded universal quantification (because we can simulate the universal guess deterministically in polynomial space).
  \item
    First, $(\forall(\DKP \cup \mathsf{co}\DKP))\mathsf{Eq} = (\forall \DKP)\mathsf{Eq}$, since $\DKP$ is closed under complement.  % \autocite[Proposition~8.4 (a)]{bdg95}
    Next, $(\forall \DKP)\mathsf{Eq} = \PKPEq$, since $\forall \DKP = \PKP$.  % \autocite[Proposition~8.3 (g)]{bdg95}
    Now if we choose $\mathcal{C} = \DKP$ in \autoref{thm:generalcompleteness}, then $\PKPEq$ has a problem that is hard for $\DKPEq$ under $\kr$ reductions.
    \qedhere
  %\item If $\mathcal{C}=\SKP$, then the $\kr$-hard problem is in $(\forall(\SKP\cup\mathsf{co}\SKP))\mathsf{Eq}=(\forall(\SKP\cup\PKP))\mathsf{Eq}=\PKPOPEq$.
  %\item Same as the previous justification, but starting with $\mathcal{C}=\PKP$.\qedhere
%  \item Same as the previous justification, but starting with $\mathcal{C}=\P$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

More specifically, this means that $\coNPEq$ (which equals $\POPEq$) has a problem which is $\kr$-hard for $\PEq$ (which equals $\DOPEq$).
This leads to \autocite[Theorem~8.7, part~1]{bcffm}, which is restated here.

\begin{corollary}[{\autocite[Theorem~8.7, part~1]{bcffm}}]
  If $\NP = \coNP$ then $\NPEq$ has a complete problem under polynomial time kernel reductions.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  If $\NP = \coNP$, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to $\POP$, and specifically $\PTP = \DTP = \POP = \coNP = \NP$.
  From \autoref{cor:hardproblems} we conclude that $\NPEq$ has a $\kr$-hard problem for $\NPEq$.
  Such a problem is by definition $\NPEq$-complete.
\end{proof}

We now return to the proof of \autoref{thm:generalcompleteness} by first providing some motivating ideas.
Recall the canonical complete problem (sometimes called the ``universal'' problem) for $\NP$ (and indeed for various other complexity classes):
\begin{displaymath}
  K = \lb\triple{M}{x}{1^t} \st M\plain{accepts} x \plain{within} t \textnormal{ steps}\rb
\end{displaymath}
The idea of this proof is to adapt this into an equivalence relation $R_K$ consisting of pairs of triples of the form $\pair{\triple{M}{x}{1^{t_x}}}{\triple{M}{y}{1^{t_y}}}$, where $M$ accepts $\pair{x}{y}$, as in the reduction from an arbitrary $\NP$ language to $K$.
The problem we encounter here is that $R_K$ is not necessarily an equivalence relation.
Consider, for example, transitivity, which must be satisfied for all possible pairs of the form $\triple{M}{w}{1^{t_w}}$.
For \emph{arbitrary machines} $M$, just because $M$ accepts $\pair{x}{y}$ and $\pair{y}{z}$ does not necessarily mean that $M$ accepts $\pair{x}{z}$.
The solution is to encode into $R_K$ the requirement that the language which $M$ accepts, $L(M)$, is itself an equivalence relation.
The three properties required of $R_K$ then follow from the properties of $L(M)$.
%
%As a technical consideration for this proof, we point out languages in $\PSPACE$ may be decided by alternating Turing machines which run in polynomial time, so it is permissible to consider polynomially clocked Turing machines.
%
\begin{proof}[Proof of \autoref{thm:generalcompleteness}]
  First we will define a helper algorithm which decides whether a given machine accepts an equivalence relation on strings up to a given length.
  Define the algorithm $A$ as follows on input $\pair{M}{n}$, where $M$ is a polynomially clocked Turing machine of type $\mathcal{C}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item universally guess $a,b,$ and $c\in\Sigma^{\leq n}$
  \item simulate $M$ on $\pair{a}{a}$; if it rejects, reject
  \item simulate $M$ on $\pair{a}{b}$, then on $\pair{b}{a}$; if the former accepts and the latter rejects, reject
  \item simulate $M$ on $\pair{a}{b}$, then on $\pair{b}{c}$, then on $\pair{a}{c}$; if the first two accept and the last one rejects, reject
  \item if execution reaches this point, accept
  \end{enumerate}
  These simulations check that $L(M)$ satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity on strings of length at most $n$.
  If $A$ accepts, then the three properties are satisfied, and if it rejects then one of the three properties is violated.
  Since $M$ is a machine of type $\mathcal{C}$, checking if $M$ accepts on some input and if $M$ rejects on some input is in $\mathcal{C}\cup\mathsf{co}\mathcal{C}$.
  The universal guesses of $a,b,$ and $c$ (of length at most $n$) followed by checks of whether the six simulations of $M$ accept or reject place $L(A)$ in the class $\CRAZY$.
  If $p$ is the polynomial which bounds the running time of $M$, then the running time of this algorithm is $6p\left(\left|\pair{1^n}{1^n}\right|\right)+c$, where $c$ is a constant which represents the time needed to account for the implementation of $A$ (the control of the simulations of $M$, performing logical conjunctions, etc.).
  Hence the running time of $A$ is polynomial in $n$.

  Now we can define the set $R_K$ by
  \begin{align*}
    R_K = {} & \lb\pair{u}{v} \st u=v\rb \\
    & \cup \lb\pair{\triple{M}{x}{1^{t_x}}}{\triple{M}{y}{1^{t_y}}} \st \textnormal{1 through 4 below are satisfied}\rb
  \end{align*}
  where the conditions are
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{itm:machine} $M$ is a polynomially clocked Turing machine of type $\mathcal{C}$
  \item\label{itm:emx} $A$ accepts $\pair{M}{|x|}$ within $t_x$ steps
  \item\label{itm:emy} $A$ accepts $\pair{M}{|y|}$ within $t_y$ steps
  \item\label{itm:accepts} $M$ accepts $\pair{x}{y}$
  \end{enumerate}
  We claim that $R_K$ is in $\CRAZYEq$ and $\CEq$-hard.

  First we show that $R_K\in\CRAZY$.
  By the argument above, $A$ is a $\CRAZY$ algorithm.
  %Since $M$ is a polynomially clocked $\mathcal{C}$ machine by \autoref{itm:machine}, then the simulation of $M$ on $\pair{x}{y}$ in \autoref{itm:accepts} can be performed by a $\mathcal{C}$ algorithm.
  Assuming without loss of generality that $|x|\geq |y|$, if $A$ accepts $\pair{M}{|x|}$ within $t_x$ steps then we know that there is a polynomial time bound on the running time of $M$ on input $\pair{x}{y}$, so simulating it is certainly in $\CRAZY$.
  Finally, testing for equality is in $\mathcal{C}$ by hypothesis so deciding $R_K$ overall can be performed by a $\CRAZY$ algorithm.

  Next we show that $R_K$ is an equivalence relation.
  Reflexivity follows from the reflexivity of the equality relation.
  For symmetry, suppose $\pair{\triple{M}{x}{1^{t_x}}}{\triple{M}{y}{1^{t_y}}}\in R_K$.
  Since \autoref{itm:emx} and \autoref{itm:emy} are true by hypothesis, we know that symmetry on strings of length at most $\max(|x|, |y|)$ in $L(M)$ is satisfied, and that includes the strings $x$ and $y$.
  So since $M$ accepts $\pair{x}{y}$ it must follow that $M$ accepts $\pair{y}{x}$.
  Furthermore, \autoref{itm:machine}, \autoref{itm:emx}, and \autoref{itm:emy} are the same up to symmetry of $x$ and $y$, so we have $\pair{\triple{M}{y}{1^{t_y}}}{\triple{M}{x}{1^{t_x}}}\in R_K$.
  For transitivity, suppose that both $\pair{\triple{M}{x}{1^{t_x}}}{\triple{M}{y}{1^{t_y}}}\in R_K$ and $\pair{\triple{M}{y}{1^{t_y}}}{\triple{M}{z}{1^{t_z}}}\in R_K$.
  Since transitivity is true on strings of length at most $\max(|x|, |y|, |z|)$ by the transitivity propositions checked by \autoref{itm:emx} and \autoref{itm:emy}, and since $M$ accepts both $\pair{x}{y}$ and $\pair{y}{z}$ by hypothesis, it must follow that $M$ accepts $\pair{x}{z}$.
  Again the conditions in \autoref{itm:machine}, \autoref{itm:emx}, and \autoref{itm:emy} are the same.
  We have shown that $R_K$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, so it is an equivalence relation.
  At this point, we have proven that $R_K\in\CRAZYEq$.

  Now we need to show that $R_K$ is $\CEq$-hard.
  Let $S\in\CEq$.
  Suppose $M$ is the polynomially clocked $\mathcal{C}$ machine which decides $S$, and $p$ is the polynomial which bounds the running time of $M$.
  Then the kernel reduction from $S$ to $R_K$ is $w\mapsto\triple{M}{w}{1^{6p(|\pair{w}{w}|)+c}}$, where $p$ and $c$ are the polynomial and constant described in the first paragraph of this proof.
  Call this reduction $f$.
  The reduction is obviously computable in time polynomial in $|w|$.
  It remains to show that this reduction is correct.

  Suppose $\pair{x}{y}\in S$.
  Now $f(x)=\triple{M}{x}{1^{6p(|\pair{x}{x}|)+c}}$ and $f(y)=\triple{M}{y}{1^{6p(|\pair{y}{y}|)+c}}$.
  \autoref{itm:machine} is true by construction, and \autoref{itm:accepts} is true since $M$ is the machine which decides $S$.
  Assume \autoref{itm:emx} is false.
  Then $M$ does not accept an equivalence relation on strings of length at most $|x|$.
  This is a contradiction, since $M$ decides $S$, an equivalence relation, by hypothesis.
  Therefore \autoref{itm:emx} must be satisfied.
  The same argument applies to \autoref{itm:emy}.
  Hence $\pair{f(x)}{f(y)}\in R_K$.

  If $\pair{x}{y}\notin S$ then $M$ does not accept $\pair{x}{y}$, since otherwise $\pair{x}{y}$ would be a member of $S$.
  Hence $\pair{x}{y}\notin R_K$.
  Therefore we have shown that $R_K$ is $\CEq$-hard.
\end{proof}

\begin{openproblem}
  Is there a more general characterization of complexity classes which have a $\kr$-hard problem?
\end{openproblem}

\begin{openproblem}
  Under what conditions does a complexity class have a complete problem?
  Can we adapt this idea to create a complete problem for $\PEq$ or $\NPEq$?
\end{openproblem}

\begin{openproblem}
  Can this theorem be used to construct $\krnt$-hard problems for smaller complexity classes like $\NLEq$ under the appropriate time-bounded reduction?
  Larger classes such as $\EXPEq$?
\end{openproblem}

\begin{openproblem}
  To what other equivalence relations does our $\kr$-hard problem reduce?
  Are there ``natural'' $\kr$-hard problems in complexity classes which satisfy the conditions in \autoref{thm:generalcompleteness}?
\end{openproblem}

%% As an additional corollary, we show that the equivalence relation $R_K$ is necessarily hard given a known hard equivalence relation under $\kr$ reductions.

%% \begin{corollary}
%%   Let $\mathcal{C}_1$ be a complexity class and $\mathcal{C}_2$ be a subset of $\PSPACE$ which contains the problem of deciding whether two strings are equal.
%%   If there exists an equivalence relation $S$ in $\CTEq$ which is hard for $\COEq$ under $\kr$ reductions, then there is an equivalence relation in $\CRAZIEREq$ which is hard for $\COEq$ under $\kr$ reductions.
%% \end{corollary}
%% \begin{proof}
%%   $S\kr R_K$ by the reduction described in the proof of \autoref{thm:generalcompleteness}.
%%   A similar analysis shows that $R_K\in\CRAZIEREq$.
%%   Since $S$ is hard for $\COEq$ and polynomial time kernel reductions compose, $R_K$ is also hard for $\COEq$.
%% \end{proof}

%% This last question leads us to briefly note that equivalence of true quantified boolean formulas is a \PSPACE-complete problem; perhaps it is also a \PSPACEEq-complete problem.
%% \begin{proposition}
%%   Define $\QBFEq$ by
%%   \begin{displaymath}
%%     \QBFEq = \{\pair{\phi}{\psi} | \phi \iff \psi\},
%%   \end{displaymath}
%%   where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are fully quantified boolean formulae.
%%   Then $\QBFEq$ is \PSPACE-complete.
%% \end{proposition}
%% \begin{proof}
%%   Suppose $\phi$ denotes $\overline{Q}\tau$, where $\overline{Q}$ represents the sequence of quantified variables and $\tau$ is the boolean formula over those variables.
%%   Then the many-one reduction from $\QBF$ is $\phi\mapsto\pair{\phi}{\exists z\colon\overline{Q}(\tau\land z)}$, where $z$ is a variable not already in $\phi$.
%%   This reduction can obviously be computed in time polynomial in the length of the input, $\phi$.
%%   If $\phi$ is not satisfiable, then no assignment of $z$ makes $\overline{Q}(\tau\land z)$ satisfiable, because $\tau$ will always be false.
%%   Hence $\exists z\colon\overline{Q}(\tau\land z)$ must be false.
%%   If $\phi$ is satisfiable, then choosing $z$ to be true makes $\overline{Q}(\tau\land z)$ true.
%%   Thus $\phi$ is satisfiable if and only if $\exists z\colon\overline{Q}(\tau\land z)$ is satisfiable, so $\QBF\mor\QBFEq$.
%%   Since $\QBFEq$ is clearly decidable in $\PSPACE$, we conclude that $\QBFEq$ is \PSPACE-complete.
%% \end{proof}
